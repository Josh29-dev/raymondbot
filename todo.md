# To do list
This is where my goals are for the bot, if you recommend something to me this'll where it will go! credit will go where credit is due of course ;)

## Economy 
This will be an economy for Raymond bot which is pretty similar to dank memer but with a Raymond touch ;) There will be a bank with all the values stored on a .JSON file, this will most likely be accompanied with a leaderboard and store within time.

## Bank file change
After the economy cog, the bank .json file will be replaced with something that will ensure stability (plus easier) Probably upgrade to something like mySQL or SQLite.

## Achievements 
*when i get to this I will think of what this should do, if you want please leave some suggestions somewhere*
