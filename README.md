# Raymond bot
This is a Python Discord bot that helps you in the most efficient way on your server, where we hope to bring premium features on other bots for free on Raymond.

## Why choose Raymond bot?
Raymond bot has many features which can be considered premium on other bots where you would have to pay money to access these features on other bots. 




## How do I work this thing?!? (for the beginners)
1. Ensure you have [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) downloaded onto your device.
2. Ensure you have [disnake](https://pypi.org/project/disnake/) downloaded onto your device also.
3. Create a bot from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) with the permissions you want the bot to have and the **token** copied to your clipboard.
4. In the ``main.py`` file use ``ctrl + F`` and search: "TOKEN". Highlight that and replace it with the token that you copied from the previous step.
